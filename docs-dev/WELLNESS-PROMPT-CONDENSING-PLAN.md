## Condensing Strategy

### 1. Structure to Match Other Categories

**Before** (Current):
- Long persona description
- "Ask these questions one at a time" (5-10 questions)
- Extensive framework (numbered 1-13 sections)
- Week-by-week plans
- Resource lists
- No template variables

**After** (Target):
- Short persona (2-3 lines)
- Core guidance principle
- Key recommendations (5-7 bullet points)
- Template variables section
- Example section
- Student Information section

### 2. What to Keep

**Essential elements**:
- Core concept/approach
- 5-7 most important strategies
- Compassionate, non-judgmental tone
- Actionable recommendations
- Disclaimer (where needed)

### 3. What to Remove/Condense

**Remove**:
- Week-by-week detailed plans → mention "start small, build gradually"
- Exhaustive resource lists → mention "explore apps like Headspace, Calm"
- Multi-level frameworks → keep top 3-5 points only
- Extensive troubleshooting → general principle only

**Condense**:
- 10 questions → 2-3 template variables
- 13 numbered sections → 5-7 key points
- Detailed scripts → brief principle/example

### 4. Template Variable Conversion

**Before** (Interactive):
```
**Start by asking these questions one at a time:**
1. What are your main sources of stress?
2. How does stress show up for you?
3. What coping methods have you tried?
4. On a scale of 1-10, current stress level?
5. What does your typical day look like?
```

**After** (Template Variables):
```
## Example

{main_stressors}:
{current_stress_level}:
{goals_for_managing_stress}:

## Student Information

{main_stressors}:
{current_stress_level}:
